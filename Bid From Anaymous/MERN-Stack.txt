I am a Full-Stack Developer with a strong knowledge base and over 7 years of experience in developing Websites and Web-Based Systems.
The technologies I use revolve around Blockchain(Solidity, Web3.js, Web3.py) Javascript (Angular/React/Vue/Node.js and so on), CSS (Bootstrap/Sass and so on), PHP (Laravel/CodeIgniter/Zend/CI), and Python(Django, Flask).
Last time I have developed NFT marketplace, Staking DApp, Defi, crypto-trading bot and etc.
Using React/Angular and Scss/Bootstrap for the Front-End Development and Laravel/CodeIgniter/Node.js/Django/Flask for the Back-End Development, after clarifying precisely what the client wants, I dive into work and quickly deliver stunning results.
